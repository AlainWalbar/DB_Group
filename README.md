## Our Subject
The Software Selling Company

A Company creating software and then selling it to different profiles of clients.
Our goals are the creation of databases to manage all the different datas entering in the functionning process of this company.



## How are we going to implement it 

- Concept and definition :
    
    First we have to draw the external system, understand how the company we're imagining is working, brainstorm together and gather ideas from every member of the group

- Link the ideas to the course :

    Then, we have to think about the database itself, the SQL code. What kind of tables are needed for our company ? We need to make sure our example fits well with the concepts learnt during class

- Divide work and precise it :

    Once the overall work is well shaped, we can start dividing the work between members and actually start the database creation process
